## :ledger: Overview

This is A powerful Smart Watch.

If you find the hardware of this watch difficult to solder or replicate, if hard to make, and you want to focus on learning coding or LVGL UI instead, you can try a new STM32F411 development board：

## :black_nib:How to download BootLoader  and upgrad APP：

Please refer to the README file in the `Firmware` folder for details: [BootLoader & APP Instructions](./Firmware/README.md)

If you find the version 2.3.3 with BootLoader too complicated, you can download branch [ver2.3.2](https://github.com/No-Chicken/OV-Watch/tree/ver2.3.2) and use the previous code.

## :rocket: Additional Features 
### The features modified in V2.4.1 include:

1. During sleep, deinitialize the UART's I/O ports and set them to input mode to reduce high sleep power consumption. Currently, the sleep state current is over 800 uA.
2. Add a long press shutdown function for KEY1 in both the BootLoader and the APP
3. Modify the BSP of the buttons in the APP so that actions occur only when the button is pressed and released, preventing some accidental touches.

### The features modified in V2.4.0 include:

1. fixed a bug in hardware in Back board, fixed the BLE circuit, now can totally disable the BLE power.
2. Added BootLoader program.
3. Added IAP OTA functionality, which enables program upgrades via Bluetooth.
4. Fixed some bugs.

## :computer:Design Details of the Software Section：

### 1.Low Power Design

The watch has three modes. The first one is the normal operating mode, where the watch functions normally. The second is the sleep mode, where the MCU enters STOP mode while the MPU6050 still counts steps. The third is the shutdown mode, where the TPS63020 directly disables, resulting in no 3V3 power supply, only Vbat is powered.

At first, the watch used the motion function of the MPU6050 from sleep to wake up, opening interrupts to wake up. However, it was found that a large shaking motion was required to trigger the interrupt. Therefore, RTC timed interrupts were eventually used to wake up, followed by periodic checks of the current gesture status. If there is a wrist lifting action, it wakes up.

note: MPU6050 cannot directly use the DMP library. After initialization, the power consumption is high and some modifications are needed to reduce power consumption. Refer to the project code for specifics.

If using the KT6368A for Bluetooth, disable Bluetooth when not use, so that can save power.

As For Test, when I testing with 3V3 as power supply, the power consumption is approximately 70-80mA in operating mode, around 1mA in standby mode, and almost no power consumption in shutdown mode, with only the RTC working. However, there was no testing of the power supply connected to the Vbat terminal powered by DCDC, and this power consumption depends entirely on the efficiency of the DCDC.

### 2.Heart Rate Blood Oxygen

The blood oxygen part has not been done yet.

Originally, the heart rate calculation used the official library, but the calculation was too slow. Later, it was changed to a simple peak detection algorithm written by ourselves. The PPG signal of the EM7028 is as shown in the figure below:

<p align="center">
	<img border="1px" width="50%" src="./images/EM7028的测量曲线.jpg">
</p>



### 3.Data Storage

Currently, an external EEPROM is used for data storage, mainly for storing settings, etc. For details, refer to the `Datasave.c` file.

### 4.Page Switching Logic

To implement page switching and return to the previous page, a stack is used to store the corresponding pages. For example, using `user_Stack_Pop(&ScrRenewStack);` pops the previous page, then enter a new page and use `user_Stack_Push(&ScrRenewStack, (long long int)&ui_HomePage);` to push the pointer address of the new page onto the stack. Note that you cannot directly push something like `ui_HomePage` onto the stack during the push operation. It dynamically changes, BIG NOTE!

```c
//key1 pressed
if(keystr == 1)
{
    user_Stack_Pop(&ScrRenewStack);
    if(user_Stack_isEmpty(&ScrRenewStack))
    {
        ui_MenuPage_screen_init();
        lv_scr_load_anim(ui_MenuPage,LV_SCR_LOAD_ANIM_MOVE_RIGHT,0,0,true);
        user_Stack_Push(&ScrRenewStack,(long long int)&ui_HomePage);
        user_Stack_Push(&ScrRenewStack,(long long int)&ui_MenuPage);
    }
    else if(ScrRenewStack.Data[ScrRenewStack.Top_Point-1] == (long long int)&ui_HomePage)
    {
        ui_HomePage_screen_init();
        lv_scr_load_anim(ui_HomePage,LV_SCR_LOAD_ANIM_MOVE_RIGHT,0,0,true);
    }
}
```

### 5.Calculator Logic

The logic of the calculator is a classic problem in computer science. The classic approach is to use two stacks, one for operators and one for numbers, and then perform operations such as popping from stacks and calculations. Taking `1+2*6/3` as an example, the specific process is shown in the animated image below. However, there is a problem with decimal points. The animated image only demonstrates the logic of integer calculations. For details on calculations involving decimal points, refer to the code.

The specific process is as follows:

1. Traverse the expression. When encountering an operand, push it onto the operand stack.
2. When encountering an operator, if the operator stack is empty, push it onto the operator stack directly.
3. If the operator stack is not empty, compare it with the top element of the operator stack: if the current operator has higher precedence than the top operator, continue to push it onto the operator stack. If the current operator has lower or equal precedence compared to the top operator, pop two operands from the operand stack, pop the top operator from the operator stack, perform the operation, and push the result onto the operand stack.
4. Continue to compare the current operator with the top element of the operator stack.
5. Continue to traverse according to the above steps. After traversal is completed, pop the elements from both stacks and perform the final calculation to obtain the final result.
